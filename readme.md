Between Us is an Android Experiment that explores distance and connectedness between two people. Pair two devices with NFC, then install the widget to see the distance between them in real-time, with fun units like basketballs, pencils, mountains and whales.

This app is open source and illustrates use of NFC for device pairing, animated widgets, power efficient background GPS updates and simple communication with a server.
